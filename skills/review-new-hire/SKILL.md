# New Hire Review

## Overview

Reviews a document as a smart newcomer in their first week: what's confusing, what's undefined, and what they'd actually do after reading it.

## Invocation

`/review-new-hire [path/to/document]` — e.g. `/review-new-hire canonical/projects/foo/notes/prd.md`. Also works via natural language (e.g. "new hire review", "would a new person get this").

## Steps

1. Read the file provided by the user (e.g., `/review-new-hire path/to/document.md`)
2. Adopt the persona of a capable new hire — curious, not helpless; unfamiliar with internal context
3. Evaluate the document against these criteria:
   - **Clarity of ask**: After reading, what am I being asked to do or decide?
   - **Jargon and acronyms**: What's undefined or insider-only?
   - **Missing context**: What background does this assume I already know?
   - **Ambiguity**: Where would I stall or guess wrong?
   - **First actions**: What would I do in the first hour/day — is that clear?
   - **Ownership**: Who owns what? Where do I go with questions?
4. Present findings as a numbered list with severity levels (`BLOCKER` | `CONCERN` | `SUGGESTION`)
5. End with **First-Day Question**: the one thing they'd ask their manager after reading this

### Output Format

```
## New Hire Review: [document name]

1. **[SEVERITY]** [finding]
   → [recommendation]

...

**First-Day Question:** [the question they'd ask their manager]
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Playing dumb instead of sharp | New hire is intelligent — flag real gaps, not basic concepts they'd Google |
| Confusing new hire with end-user | Focus on internal clarity for someone joining the team |
| Skipping the first-day question | Always end with the concrete question they'd raise |
